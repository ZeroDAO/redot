# Redlight

A lightweight client designed for validators to complete tasks, currently supporting data availability verification for Melodot. This is an initial implementation, and more verification tasks will be supported in the future. Currently, the results of data availability are obtained through the lightweight client's RPC, but in the future, the DAS lightweight client will be directly compiled into it.
